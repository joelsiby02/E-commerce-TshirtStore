# E-Commerce Store with ConvoQuery Integration

## Overview

This project is a futuristic E-commerce store designed to integrate the ConvoQuery application, a generative AI application developed by myself. The purpose of this integration is to leverage Web Development and generative AI concepts to help storage managers retrieve valuable insights from their store database using natural language queries. By doing so, it aims to improve sales by allowing managers to analyze patterns and trends and make informed decisions for the future making their life a ton ease!!

## Project Objectives

- Learning frontend and backend development.
- Learning  Backend Integration Process
- Learning Html/Css/Javascript by creating Real time Projects
- Integrating my exisiting generative-ai ConvoQuery application into a real time website.
- Leverage data science skills to assist storage managers.
- Ease the querying process for storage managers by getting rid of complex SQL query retrievels.
- Utilize large language models (LLMs) to solve real-world problems.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for querying and analyzing store data.
- Serve as a mini project for college, demonstrating practical application of learned skills.
- Improve collaboration and teamwork skills by working on the project with a team.

## Current Status

The project is currently under development. Frontend and backend components are being implemented, and integration with the ConvoQuery application is in progress. Building a Prototype as me myself acting as a storage manager for this Ecommerce Webiste with my own custom SQL Database, a prototype website store is being built to analyze and identify hidden trends from a simulated database. This prototype will serve as a testing ground for the project's functionality and usability.

## Deployment

The project has been deployed on Vercel for demonstration purposes. You can access the deployed version [here](https://team6-pi.vercel.app/).

## How to Use

1. Visit the deployed application link.
2. Explore the E-commerce store interface
3. Rest of the steps will be updated after the project is being fully developed!
